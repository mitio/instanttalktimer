# Instant Talk Timer

No-frills talk timer in a single HTML file.

## Installation

Clone the repo somewhere or get the files.

## Usage

Open `index.html` and set the desired duration in minutes as a query parameter, like so:

	index.html?45

This will start the timer at 45 minutes.

When more than 80% of the time has elapsed, the background will change to red.

## Demo

You can find a [live demo here](http://ddimitrov.name/instanttalktimer/?5).

Good luck with your presentations!
